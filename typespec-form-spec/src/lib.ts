 * Named diagnostics for everything that makes an artifact wrong, and state keys for

 * The split between these and the linter rules in `linter.ts` is forced rather than
 * chosen: a TypeSpec linter rule may only be a warning. So a check whose failure means the
 * emitted artifact is broken is reported from `$onValidate` as an error, and the linter
 * carries the checks that describe a specification worth tidying.
